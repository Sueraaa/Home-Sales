# Home-Sales
In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Questions
1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

`spark.sql("""
SELECT YEAR(date) AS year,
       ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM HomeSales
WHERE bedrooms = 4
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
ORDER BY year
""").show()`

2. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

`spark.sql("""
SELECT date_built AS year_built,
       ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM HomeSales
WHERE bedrooms = 3
  AND bathrooms = 3
GROUP BY date_built
ORDER BY year_built
""").show()`

3. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

`spark.sql("""
SELECT date_built AS year_built,
       ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM HomeSales
WHERE bedrooms = 3
  AND bathrooms = 3
  AND floors = 2
  AND sqft_living >= 2000
GROUP BY date_built
ORDER BY year_built
""").show()`

4. What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.

`spark.sql("""
SELECT view,
       ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM HomeSales
GROUP BY view
HAVING avg_price >= 350000
ORDER BY view DESC
""").show()`
